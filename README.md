## SignUpForm Android App
##### By: Sean Reddington


- This is a simple app that simulates a sign up activity to "create" an account. The user can enter in the fields and click the button to "sign up" (doesn't actually sign up for anything).

- The app also features a required field check which will flag red if any of the fields are empty on sign up click.

- The app also includes a check that the passwords match. The app will display a toast alerting that the passwords do not match.

- If both input checks pass, the user will be prompted with a toast confirming account creation.
